## Purpose

This document fixes the operator-facing contract for `fcp.gmail`. The connector exposes the Gmail API surface implemented in this crate: messages, mailbox listing, history sync, labels, threads, drafts, and sending.

The connector is intentionally a bounded mailbox bridge. It is not a Google Workspace admin connector, contact connector, Calendar connector, watch-channel manager, mailbox backup system, or general MIME processing toolkit.

## Current Runtime Snapshot

The current crate exposes these operations:

- `gmail.send_message`
- `gmail.get_message`
- `gmail.list_messages`
- `gmail.sync_history`
- `gmail.modify_message`
- `gmail.trash_message`
- `gmail.get_thread`
- `gmail.list_labels`
- `gmail.get_draft`
- `gmail.create_draft`
- `gmail.send_draft`

Important runtime truths the contract preserves:

- Package and binary name are `fcp-gmail`.
- Runtime `BaseConnector` ID is `gmail`.
- Manifest connector ID is `fcp.gmail`.
- Configuration uses shared Google auth selection at the top level: direct bearer token, `credential_id`, or `oauth_refresh`.
- Direct bearer-token mode returns `configured`.
- `credential_id` mode is secretless and returns `configured_pending_token_materialization`.
- `oauth_refresh` mode can materialize granted scopes and lets `doctor()`/`self_check()` detect scope-limited operation coverage.
- Configuration accepts either explicit `required_scopes` or `scope_triggers`; both together are rejected.
- Default base URL is `https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1`.
- Public base URLs must use HTTPS and target `googleapis.com` or a `googleapis.com` subdomain.
- `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` are accepted with HTTP or HTTPS for deterministic loopback tests.
- All base URLs reject userinfo, query strings, and fragments.
- Runtime request timeout is 30 seconds.
- The client uses the shared retry loop with `max_retries = 3`, `initial_delay_ms = 1000`, and `max_delay_ms = 60000`.
- The client retries retryable Google REST errors; 401 and 403 map to Unauthorized, and 429 maps to RateLimited with retry guidance.
- Message IDs, thread IDs, and draft IDs used in URL path segments are validated to reject empty strings, slashes, backslashes, traversal, and encoded slash/backslash variants.
- Runtime handshake installs a `CapabilityVerifier`.
- `invoke` requires `operation`, `input`, and `capability_token`; it validates input, computes resource URIs, and verifies a bound capability token before provider execution.
- `simulate` validates operation inventory, input shape, configured state, handshaken state, and bound capability token before returning an allowed result.
- `gmail.sync_history` persists a cursor file and requires `lease_seq` as a singleton-writer fencing token.
- `health()` reports local configuration/auth/scope state and request metrics.
- `doctor()` and `self_check()` probe Gmail reachability through `list_labels()` when credentials are materialized, and degrade for `credential_id` mode.
- `handle_shutdown()` shuts down the client runtime and clears base configured/handshaken flags.

## Drift Visible In This Checkout

This README documents the runtime truth and keeps current drift visible:

- Runtime handshake returns placeholder manifest hash `sha256:gmail-connector-v1`.
- Manifest event caps say `streaming = true` with `min_buffer_events = 50`, but runtime handshake reports `streaming = false` with `min_buffer_events = 100`.
- Manifest `gmail.list_messages` input schema mentions `label_ids`, but runtime input validation and client dispatch use `query`, `max_results`, and `page_token`.
- Manifest AI hints mention `gmail.search_messages` and `gmail.modify_labels`, but neither operation exists in runtime dispatch.
- Runtime introspection marks `gmail.trash_message` idempotency as `BestEffort`; manifest marks it `strict`.
- Runtime base URL policy accepts any `googleapis.com` subdomain, while manifest operation allowlists name `gmail.googleapis.com` and `www.googleapis.com`.
- Runtime `handle_shutdown` does not clear stored `config`, `client`, `verifier`, or `session_id` fields, though it marks base configured/handshaken flags false.
- There is no dedicated tracked verification shell script for this connector.

A follow-up parity bead should align list-message schema, event caps, idempotency metadata, base URL policy wording, manifest hints, shutdown state cleanup, and placeholder manifest proof.

## First-Slice Scope

The current Gmail README slice documents the existing runtime surface:

- shared Google bearer-token, credential-reference, and OAuth refresh auth selection
- Gmail API base URL policy and loopback test allowance
- message send/read/list/modify/trash, thread read, label list, draft read/create/send, and history sync operations
- bound capability-token verification during both `invoke` and `simulate`
- singleton-writer history cursor fencing and durable cursor persistence
- provider error mapping, retry behavior, redaction posture, doctor behavior, health behavior, and shutdown behavior
- deterministic WireMock tests and direct proof commands

## Auth And Scope Boundary

- Authentication mechanisms: Google bearer token, host credential reference, or OAuth refresh material through the shared Google auth layer.
- Home zone: `z:private`.
- Allowed source zones: `z:owner` and `z:private`.
- Allowed target zone: `z:private`.
- Forbidden zones: `z:public` and `z:work`.
- Runtime capability surface:
  - `gmail.read` gates message reads, message listing, thread reads, and label listing.
  - `gmail.history.read` gates restart-safe mailbox history sync.
  - `gmail.write` gates label modification and draft read/create.
  - `gmail.send` gates sending new messages and sending drafts.
  - `gmail.delete` gates moving messages to trash.
- The connector does not persist messages, labels, threads, drafts, access tokens, credential IDs, provider payloads, or provider error bodies beyond process memory.
- The exception is the `gmail.sync_history` cursor state file, which stores history ID, lease sequence, optional lease object ID, and update timestamp.
- Gmail data can include personal email contents, recipients, subject lines, labels, snippets, thread context, draft content, and mailbox metadata. Treat all live reads and writes as private-zone data.

## Network And Runtime Invariants

- Production host: `gmail.googleapis.com`.
- Production API prefix: `/gmail/v1`.
- Production port: `443`.
- TLS and SNI are required by the manifest for live traffic.
- Manifest network policy denies localhost, private ranges, tailnet ranges, and IP literals for live operations.
- Runtime loopback base URLs are test-only.
- Runtime request timeout: `30 seconds`.
- Manifest connect timeout is `10000 ms` for Gmail operations.
- Manifest total timeout is `30000 ms` for most operations and `60000 ms` for list/history operations.
- Manifest maximum response bytes range from `1048576` to `10485760`.
- Sandbox profile is `strict`, with `256 MB` memory, `50%` CPU, `120000 ms` wall-clock timeout, read-only `/usr` and `/lib`, writable `$CONNECTOR_STATE`, no exec, and no ptrace.
- The connector does not open inbound sockets.
- The connector does not implement Gmail watch channels, Pub/Sub, replay streaming, or webhook ingress.

## Capability Families

| Capability | Purpose |

| `gmail.write` | Modify message labels and read/create drafts. |
| `gmail.send` | Send new messages and send saved drafts. |
| `gmail.delete` | Move messages to trash. |
| `media.download` | Manifest optional capability; not used by runtime capability verification in this slice. |
| `media.upload` | Manifest optional capability; not used by runtime capability verification in this slice. |

## Operation Inventory

| Operation | Endpoint shape | Capability | SafetyTier | RiskLevel | Idempotency | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `gmail.send_message` | `POST /gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send` | `gmail.send` | `Dangerous` | `High` | `None` | Sends a new email from raw MIME or structured fields. |
| `gmail.get_message` | `GET /gmail/v1/users/me/messages/{message_id}` | `gmail.read` | `Safe` | `Low` | `Strict` | Reads one Gmail message by message ID. |

| `gmail.get_draft` | `GET /gmail/v1/users/me/drafts/{draft_id}` | `gmail.write` | `Risky` | `Medium` | `Strict` | Reads one saved draft. |
| `gmail.create_draft` | `POST /gmail/v1/users/me/drafts` | `gmail.write` | `Risky` | `Medium` | `None` | Creates an unsent draft from raw MIME or structured fields. |
| `gmail.send_draft` | `POST /gmail/v1/users/me/drafts/send` | `gmail.send` | `Dangerous` | `High` | `None` | Sends a saved draft and consumes it. |

## Resource URIs

Runtime capability-token verification binds operations to these resource URI shapes:

| Operation | Resource URI |
|-----------|--------------|
| `gmail.send_message` | `gmail:messages:send` |
| `gmail.get_message` | `gmail:message:{message_id}` |
| `gmail.modify_message` | `gmail:message:{message_id}` |
| `gmail.trash_message` | `gmail:message:{message_id}` |
| `gmail.list_messages` | `gmail:messages` |
| `gmail.sync_history` | `gmail:history` |
| `gmail.get_thread` | `gmail:thread:{thread_id}` |
| `gmail.list_labels` | `gmail:labels` |
| `gmail.get_draft` | `gmail:draft:{draft_id}` |
| `gmail.send_draft` | `gmail:draft:{draft_id}` |
| `gmail.create_draft` | `gmail:drafts:create` |

## Explicit Non-Goals

The current implementation does not include:

- Gmail watch channels, Pub/Sub setup, webhook ingress, replay streams, or mailbox event fanout
- attachments download/upload, MIME tree normalization, inline image extraction, or message body rendering
- label create/update/delete, thread modify/trash, message untrash, message delete, batch modify, batch delete, import, insert, or SMTP-like sending
- filters, settings, delegates, forwarding addresses, vacation settings, send-as aliases, signatures, or profile management
- multi-mailbox delegation, domain-wide delegation provisioning, service account setup, Admin SDK integration, Contacts/People API integration, or Calendar integration
- durable message store, search index, mailbox export, backup, or retention-policy engine

These are excluded on purpose:

- Gmail contains private user data and live sends are side-effecting.
- History sync needs explicit singleton-writer fencing before broader replay semantics are added.
- Attachments and MIME rendering need separate media redaction and size-limit contracts.

## Readiness And Verification Surface

`doctor()`, `health()`, `self_check()`, `simulate()`, and `introspect()` are part of the public closeout contract. They surface:

- configuration, auth mode, base URL, history cursor path, required scopes, granted scopes, and request metrics
- credential-reference degraded state when host token injection is required
- scope-limited operation inventory when OAuth refresh grants are authoritative but insufficient
- provider-backed readiness through `list_labels()` when credentials are materialized
- operation metadata with capability, risk, safety tier, idempotency, approval mode, schemas, and hints
- bound capability-token verification during `invoke`
- simulation denial for unknown operation, invalid input, unconfigured connector, missing handshake, and bound capability-token mismatch
- typed provider/FCP error mapping

The deterministic integration evidence is anchored on connector-local tests covering:

- lifecycle, configuration, base URL policy, loopback allowance, introspection, simulation, doctor, self-check, and shutdown behavior
- message get/list/send/modify/trash, thread get, label list, draft get/create/send, and history sync through deterministic HTTP fixtures
- cursor persistence and resumed history sync with `lease_seq` fencing
- invoke rejection for unknown operation, missing token, missing input, wrong capability, and pre-provider capability verification
- provider 401, 403, 404, 429, 500 classes and FCP error mapping
- shared Google discovery/provisioning overlap for list, send, and history metadata

## Verification Bundle

There is no dedicated tracked `scripts/e2e/gmail_connector_verification.sh` bundle in this checkout. The closeout surface is the crate-local test suite plus direct `rch` proof commands.

The verification surface captures:

- runtime operation inventory and policy metadata
- deterministic WireMock coverage for Gmail API paths
- shared Google auth, endpoint policy, provider error, lifecycle, simulation, history cursor, and introspection tests
- formatting, check, test, and clippy proof through `rch`
- UBS on changed files before commit

## Operator Guidance

**Prerequisites**:

- Use a Gmail test account or Workspace test tenant for live proof.
- Prefer credential-reference mode when host policy should own Google secret material.
- Use loopback WireMock fixtures for routine proof.
- For OAuth refresh proof, request only the Gmail scopes needed for the operation family under test.

**Dedicated environment**:

- Keep live test messages, drafts, labels, and trash operations separate from personal or production mailboxes.
- Do not run send proof against real recipients unless the side effect is intentional and approved.
- Use a dedicated history cursor path for each proof run to avoid cross-run cursor contamination.

**Redaction rules**:

- Redact access tokens, refresh tokens, credential IDs where needed, client IDs/secrets, email addresses, message IDs, thread IDs, draft IDs, subject lines, snippets, body text, headers, label names, history IDs, cursor paths when sensitive, provider payloads, provider error bodies, and endpoint URLs that reveal tenant topology.
- Verification output should use operation IDs, endpoint shapes, auth mode, host class, result counts, status/error classes, retry decisions, and payload-shape summaries.

**Common remediation**:

- If configuration fails, provide exactly one Google auth source and do not mix `required_scopes` with `scope_triggers`.
- If `credential_id` self-check degrades, materialize host credentials through the egress proxy before invoking provider operations.
- If OAuth refresh self-check reports `scope_limited`, request the missing Gmail scopes or avoid the operations listed in the report.
- If `gmail.sync_history` conflicts, inspect `lease_seq`, `lease_object_id`, and the persisted cursor state before retrying.
- If `gmail.list_messages` filters do not behave as expected, use runtime `query` syntax rather than manifest-only `label_ids`.
- If provider returns 403, treat it as an auth/scope/permission failure rather than a retryable transport error.

**Rerun commands**:

- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-gmail-readme cargo check -p fcp-gmail --all-targets`
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-gmail-readme cargo test -p fcp-gmail --tests -- --nocapture`
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-gmail-readme cargo clippy -p fcp-gmail --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`
- `ubs connectors/gmail/README.md`
