## Purpose

This document fixes the operator-facing contract for `fcp.google-calendar`. The connector exposes the Google Calendar API surface implemented in this crate: calendar listing and lookup, event CRUD, natural-language quick add, free/busy lookup, recurring-event instance listing, and incremental event sync.

The connector is intentionally a bounded calendar bridge. It is not a full Google Workspace client, Calendar settings manager, ACL manager, channel watcher, push-notification receiver, Meet provisioning client, task client, contact client, or long-running calendar warehouse.

## Current Runtime Snapshot

The current crate exposes these operations:

- `gcal.list_calendars`
- `gcal.get_calendar`
- `gcal.list_events`
- `gcal.get_event`
- `gcal.create_event`
- `gcal.update_event`
- `gcal.delete_event`
- `gcal.quick_add`
- `gcal.freebusy`
- `gcal.list_event_instances`
- `gcal.sync_events`

Important runtime truths the contract preserves:

- Configuration defaults `service_selector` to `calendar` and requires that it resolves to `calendar:v3`.
- Configuration requires exactly one Google auth source accepted by the shared Google discovery auth layer.
- Supported auth inputs include direct bearer token fields accepted by the shared layer, `credential_id`, and `oauth_refresh`.
- Direct bearer-token mode sends the Google Authorization header through `GoogleRestExecutor`.
- `credential_id` mode is secretless; self-check reports `credential_injection_required` because the egress proxy must inject credentials.
- Default base URL is `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3`.
- Public base URLs must use HTTPS, must target exact host `www.googleapis.com`, and must not contain userinfo, query strings, or fragments.
- `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` are accepted with HTTP or HTTPS for deterministic loopback tests.
- Required scopes come from the embedded Google provisioning bundle. Callers may provide explicit `required_scopes`, or provide `scope_triggers`, but not both.
- Runtime request timeout is 30 seconds.
- The client uses the shared retry loop with three retries, 1000 ms initial delay, 60 second max delay, and jitter.
- Calendar IDs, event IDs, query values, quick-add text, sync tokens, and page tokens are percent-encoded before provider calls.
- Provider 401, 404, 429 with `Retry-After`, retryable transport/5xx classes, malformed JSON, and API error bodies map into typed connector and FCP errors.
- Handshake installs a `CapabilityVerifier`.
- `invoke` resolves the requested operation's capability from runtime introspection and verifies a bound capability token before provider execution.

## Drift Visible In This Checkout

This README documents the runtime truth and keeps current drift visible:

- Runtime `BaseConnector` ID is `google-calendar`, while the manifest connector ID is `fcp.google-calendar`.
- Runtime handshake returns placeholder manifest hash `sha256:google-calendar-connector-v1`.
- Manifest `event_caps.streaming = true`, but runtime handshake reports `streaming = false`, runtime introspection has no events, and no watch/channel flow is implemented.
- Runtime `simulate` returns allowed for any syntactically valid `SimulateRequest`; it does not validate operation inventory, readiness, input schema, capability, or capability token.
- Manifest `gcal.create_event` declares `start` and `end` as objects, while runtime requires RFC3339 strings and wraps them as `EventDateTime.dateTime`.
- Manifest `gcal.update_event` says idempotency is `strict`; runtime introspection says `BestEffort`, and runtime sends a sparse `PUT` event object that can clear omitted fields and arrays.
- Manifest output names for list/delete operations drift from runtime output names. Runtime `list_events` returns `events`, `next_page_token`, and `summary`; runtime `delete_event` returns `status: deleted`.
- Runtime `handle_shutdown` shuts down the client runtime but does not clear config, client, verifier, session, or configured/handshaken flags.
- There is no dedicated tracked verification shell script for this connector.

A follow-up parity bead should align simulation, manifest/runtime event capability, start/end schemas, update semantics, output schemas, manifest hash/interface proof, and shutdown state reset.

## First-Slice Scope

The current Google Calendar README slice documents the existing runtime surface:

- Google bearer-token, credential-reference, and OAuth refresh auth selection through the shared Google layer
- Calendar service selection and scope-trigger handling
- Calendar base URL policy and loopback test allowance
- calendar list/get, event list/get/create/update/delete, quick add, freebusy, recurring instances, and incremental sync
- bound capability-token verification during invoke
- provider error mapping, retry behavior, redaction posture, and health behavior
- lifecycle, doctor, health, self-check, introspection, simulation, invoke, and shutdown surfaces
- deterministic WireMock tests and direct proof commands

## Auth And Scope Boundary

- Authentication mechanisms: Google bearer token, host credential reference, or OAuth refresh material through the shared Google discovery auth layer.
- Home zone: `z:work`.
- Allowed source zones: `z:owner`, `z:private`, and `z:work`.
- Allowed target zone: `z:work`.
- Forbidden zone: `z:public`.
- Runtime capability surface:
  - `gcal.read` gates calendar lookup, event reads, freebusy, recurring instances, and sync.
  - `gcal.write` gates event creation, event update, and quick add.
  - `gcal.delete` gates event deletion.
- Manifest capability surface uses the same three capability names.
- The connector does not persist calendars, events, attendees, email addresses, tokens, credential IDs, provider payloads, or provider error bodies beyond process memory.
- Read operations can still expose private calendar metadata, attendee information, locations, descriptions, and availability. Treat all live reads as private or work-zone data.

## Network And Runtime Invariants

- Production host: `www.googleapis.com`.
- Production API prefix: `/calendar/v3`.
- Production port: `443`.
- TLS and SNI are required by the manifest for live traffic.
- Manifest network policy denies localhost, private ranges, tailnet ranges, and IP literals for live operations.
- Runtime loopback base URLs are test-only.
- Runtime request timeout: `30 seconds`.
- Manifest network constraints use `10_000 ms` connect timeout and either `30_000 ms` or `60_000 ms` total timeout depending on operation.
- Manifest maximum response bytes are `1_048_576`, `5_242_880`, or `10_485_760` depending on operation size.
- Sandbox profile is `strict`, with `256 MB` memory, `50%` CPU, `120_000 ms` wall-clock timeout, no exec, and no ptrace.
- The connector does not implement Calendar channels, watch renewal, webhook receiving, or streaming replay.

## Explicit Non-Goals

The current implementation does not include:

- Calendar ACLs, calendar create/update/delete, settings, colors, channels, watches, or push notifications
- event import, move, patch, attachments, conference-data creation, Meet creation, reminders, extended properties, or event type controls
- OAuth consent setup, Calendar API enablement, service-account/domain-wide delegation provisioning, or Google Workspace tenant onboarding
- durable event caches, sync-token storage, event warehouse export, alerting, deduped watch replay, or long-running pagination jobs
- recurring-rule authoring beyond passing event fields currently represented in the local `Event` type
- connector-local credential vaulting

These are excluded on purpose:

- Calendar data routinely contains private attendees, locations, descriptions, and availability.
- Provider watch/channel behavior needs lease, renewal, callback, and replay contracts that are separate from this request-response slice.
- Full event authoring is a larger compatibility surface than the current typed runtime supports.

## Readiness And Verification Surface

`doctor()`, `health()`, `self_check()`, `simulate()`, and `introspect()` are part of the public closeout contract. They surface:

- configuration, client state, auth mode, base URL, service identity, required scopes, and request counters
- operation metadata with capability, risk, safety tier, idempotency, schemas, and AI hints
- bound capability-token verification during `invoke`
- current simulation behavior, which is permissive
- provider-backed self-check through `users/me/calendarList?maxResults=1` when credentials are materialized
- degraded self-check for secretless credential references
- redacted auth labels and typed provider/FCP error mapping

The deterministic integration evidence is anchored on connector-local tests covering:

- calendar list/get, event list/get/create/delete, quick add, freebusy, recurring instances, and calendar lookup
- 401, 404, 429, retryable transport/server classes, JSON errors, and FCP error mapping
- base URL validation, localhost loopback allowance, redaction, credential-reference configuration, and self-check behavior
- invoke rejection for wrong capability, unknown operation, missing fields, and pre-provider capability verification

## Verification Bundle

There is no dedicated tracked `scripts/e2e/google_calendar_connector_verification.sh` bundle in this checkout. The closeout surface is the crate-local test suite plus direct `rch` proof commands.

The verification surface captures:

- runtime operation inventory and policy metadata
- deterministic WireMock coverage for Calendar API paths
- auth, endpoint policy, provider error, lifecycle, simulation, and introspection tests
- formatting, check, test, and clippy proof through `rch`
- UBS on changed files before commit

## Operator Guidance

**Prerequisites**:

- Use a Google Workspace or Google account test calendar for live verification.
- Prefer credential-reference mode when host policy should own Google secret material.
- Use loopback WireMock fixtures for routine proof.

**Dedicated environment**:

- Keep test calendars separate from personal and production calendars.
- Use `primary` only in controlled fixtures; prefer explicit calendar IDs in shared environments.
- Use historical time windows for stable list/freebusy proof.
- Treat quick-add text as provider-interpreted input and avoid ambiguous dates in live checks.

**Redaction rules**:

- Redact access tokens, credential IDs where needed, calendar IDs when sensitive, event IDs, attendee emails, organizer/creator identities, descriptions, locations, provider payloads, provider error bodies, and endpoint URLs when they reveal tenant topology.
- Verification output should use operation IDs, endpoint shapes, auth mode, host class, result counts, status/error classes, retry decisions, and payload-shape summaries.

**Common remediation**:

- If configuration fails, provide exactly one Google auth source and a service selector that resolves to `calendar:v3`.
- If live checks are degraded with `credential_injection_required`, inject host credentials before running the probe.
- If `create_event` fails validation, pass `start` and `end` as RFC3339 strings in the current runtime contract.
- If `update_event` clears data, include every field that must survive the provider `PUT`.
- If recurring instances are missing, verify the event ID is a recurring event series and the time window covers expected occurrences.
- If sync fails, do not mix `sync_token` with time filters; restart from a full sync when Google rejects an expired sync token.

**Rerun commands**:

- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-google-calendar-readme cargo check -p fcp-google-calendar --all-targets`
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-google-calendar-readme cargo test -p fcp-google-calendar --tests -- --nocapture`
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/fcp-google-calendar-readme cargo clippy -p fcp-google-calendar --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`
