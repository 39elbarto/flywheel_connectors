## Purpose

This document fixes the operator-facing contract for `fcp.notion`. The connector exposes the Notion workspace surface implemented in this crate: pages, databases, blocks, search, and comments through the Notion REST API.

The connector is intentionally a bounded workspace bridge. It is not a full Notion administration client, OAuth setup flow, webhook listener, durable replay engine, file-upload client, user-directory synchronizer, template manager, data-source parity layer, or Notion SDK wrapper.

## Current Runtime Snapshot

The current crate exposes these operations:

- `notion.create_page`
- `notion.get_page`
- `notion.update_page`
- `notion.delete_page`
- `notion.get_database`
- `notion.create_database`
- `notion.update_database`
- `notion.query_database`
- `notion.search`
- `notion.get_block`
- `notion.update_block`
- `notion.delete_block`
- `notion.get_block_children`
- `notion.append_blocks`
- `notion.add_comment`
- `notion.list_comments`

Important runtime truths the contract preserves:

- Package, library, and binary name are `fcp-notion`.
- Manifest and connector ID are `fcp.notion`.
- Manifest version is `0.1.0`.
- Manifest format is `wasi`.
- Configuration requires exactly one auth source:
  - `token`
  - `credential_id`
- Direct token mode sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `credential_id` mode sends `X-FCP-Credential-ID` and expects host egress policy to inject real secret material.
- `credential_id` must be a valid UUID.
- Default runtime API URL is `https://api.notion.com/v1`.
- Direct token mode accepts only `https://api.notion.com` or loopback test URLs.
- `credential_id` mode accepts custom absolute URLs with a host and no userinfo, query string, or fragment.
- Default `Notion-Version` is `2026-03-11`.
- `notion_version` may come from config, `FCP_NOTION_API_VERSION`, or the default.
- `notion_version` validation checks date shape only. It does not verify that Notion released that version.
- Runtime request timeout is 30 seconds.
- Runtime request-context timeout is 30 seconds.
- The client uses the shared retry loop with `max_retries = 2`.
- `health()` reports configured client state and counters. It does not perform a live Notion probe.
- `doctor()` performs local configuration and credential-injection checks only. It does not call Notion.
- `self_check()` performs a live `POST /search` probe only in direct-token mode.
- `credential_id` self-check reports degraded `credential_injection_required` and skips a live probe.
- Runtime `invoke` uses the JSON field `operation`, not `operation_id`.
- Runtime `invoke` requires a deserializable, bound `CapabilityToken`.
- Runtime `invoke` verifies the bound capability token against the operation capability and operation ID.
- Runtime `simulate` always returns allowed after deserializing a `SimulateRequest`.
- Runtime `simulate` does not check configuration, handshake, operation name, input shape, approval policy, or capability token.
- Runtime `shutdown()` logs client shutdown and returns `{ "status": "shutdown" }`.
- Runtime `shutdown()` does not clear config, client, verifier, session, or base lifecycle state.

## Runtime API Adapter

The runtime uses these request shapes:

| Operation | Runtime request | Required input | Output handling |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `notion.create_page` | `POST /pages` | `parent` | Returns `{ "page": ... }`. Runtime does not require `properties` even though the manifest schema does. |
| `notion.get_page` | `GET /pages/{page_id}` | `page_id` | Returns `{ "page": ... }`. |
| `notion.update_page` | `PATCH /pages/{page_id}` with `{ "properties": ... }` | `page_id` | Missing `properties` becomes `{}` at runtime. |
| `notion.delete_page` | `PATCH /pages/{page_id}` with `{ "archived": true }` | `page_id` | Soft archives the page and returns `{ "page": ... }`. |
| `notion.get_database` | `GET /databases/{database_id}` | `database_id` | Returns `{ "database": ... }`. |
| `notion.create_database` | `POST /databases` | `parent`, `title`, `properties` | Returns `{ "database": ... }`. |
| `notion.update_database` | `PATCH /databases/{database_id}` | `database_id` | Forwards optional `title`, `properties`, and `description`. |
| `notion.query_database` | `POST /databases/{database_id}/query` | `database_id` | Returns `results`, `has_more`, and `next_cursor`. |
| `notion.search` | `POST /search` | none | Returns redacted `results`, pagination fields, result count, sensitivity, provenance, and taint metadata. |
| `notion.get_block` | `GET /blocks/{block_id}` | `block_id` | Returns `{ "block": ... }`. |
| `notion.update_block` | `PATCH /blocks/{block_id}` | `block_id` | Removes `block_id` from the input and sends all remaining fields. |
| `notion.delete_block` | `PATCH /blocks/{block_id}` with `{ "archived": true }` | `block_id` | Soft archives the block and returns `{ "block": ... }`. |
| `notion.get_block_children` | `GET /blocks/{block_id}/children` | `block_id` | Returns `results`, `has_more`, and `next_cursor`. Runtime does not accept `start_cursor` here. |
| `notion.append_blocks` | `PATCH /blocks/{block_id}/children` | `block_id`, `children` | Sends `{ "children": ... }` and returns `results`. |
| `notion.add_comment` | `POST /comments` | `parent` | Returns `{ "comment": ... }`. Runtime does not require `rich_text` even though the manifest schema does. |
| `notion.list_comments` | `GET /comments?block_id={block_id}` | `block_id` | Returns `results`, `has_more`, and `next_cursor`. Runtime does not accept `start_cursor` here. |

Identifier and cursor handling is deliberately restrictive:

- Page, database, block, and comment IDs reject empty strings, slashes, backslashes, query markers, fragments, ampersands, equals signs, percent signs, spaces, tabs, newlines, and null bytes.
- Accepted ID path segments are percent encoded before being placed into request paths.
- Pagination cursors reject empty strings, control characters, and values longer than 512 bytes.
- `query_database` accepts an optional safe `start_cursor`.
- `search` accepts optional `query`, `filter`, and safe `start_cursor`.

## Drift Visible In This Checkout

This README documents runtime truth and keeps current drift visible:

- Current Notion docs describe the API base URL as `https://api.notion.com` and require a `Notion-Version` header on REST API requests. Runtime appends `/v1` in its base URL and sends `Notion-Version: 2026-03-11`.
- Current Notion docs introduce the data-source object and data-source query APIs after the database/data-source split. Runtime still exposes database-centric operations and calls `/databases/{database_id}/query`.
- Current Notion docs describe cursor values as opaque. Runtime validates cursor byte length and control characters before forwarding them.
- Current Notion docs describe append-block limits, including a maximum of 100 block children in one request. Runtime documents this in hints but does not enforce the 100-child limit before sending.
- Manifest schemas require `properties` for `notion.create_page` and `notion.update_page`. Runtime only requires `parent` for create and defaults missing update properties to `{}`.
- Manifest schema requires `rich_text` for `notion.add_comment`. Runtime only checks `parent`.
- Manifest operation approval modes are policy or interactive for write/delete operations. Runtime introspection reports no approval metadata for all operations.
- Manifest rate-limit pools exist for read, write, delete, and search at 3 requests per 1000 ms with burst 3. Runtime introspection reports no rate-limit metadata.
- Manifest event capabilities advertise streaming support with no replay and a 50-event minimum buffer. Runtime does not expose subscribe or unsubscribe handlers in the stdio entrypoint.
- Handshake grants every requested capability without filtering against the manifest optional capability list.
- Handshake returns the hardcoded manifest hash `sha256:notion-connector-v1`, not the manifest interface hash.
- Configure does not reset an existing handshake, verifier, or session.
- Health does not require a completed handshake.
- `simulate` is not an authorization preview. It is a permissive deserialization check.
- Shutdown does not clear runtime lifecycle state.
- There is no dedicated tracked verification shell script for this connector.

A follow-up parity bead should reconcile database/data-source endpoint naming, align runtime input validation with manifest schemas, expose manifest approval and rate-limit metadata through introspection, enforce append child count before the provider call, make simulate match invoke policy, filter granted capabilities during handshake, and decide whether shutdown should clear lifecycle state.

## First-Slice Scope

The current Notion README slice documents the existing runtime surface:

- token and credential-id configuration
- API URL and Notion API version handling
- Notion page, database, block, search, and comment operations
- lifecycle, doctor, health, self-check, simulate, introspect, invoke, and shutdown behavior
- provider error mapping, retry behavior, timeout behavior, redaction, ID validation, and cursor validation
- runtime/manifest/provider-doc drift around data sources, schemas, approvals, rate limits, events, simulation, and lifecycle reset
- deterministic WireMock integration tests

## Auth And Zone Boundary

- Authentication mechanisms: direct Notion integration token or host credential reference.
- Home zone: `z:work`.
- Allowed source zones: `z:owner`, `z:private`, and `z:work`.
- Allowed target zone: `z:work`.
- Forbidden zone: `z:public`.
- Runtime capability families:
  - `notion.read`
  - `notion.write`
  - `notion.delete`
  - `notion.search`
- Manifest required capabilities are `network.dns`, `network.egress`, `network.tls.sni`, and `storage.state`.
- Optional manifest capability `media.download` is declared but not mapped to an operation in this runtime.
- The connector does not intentionally persist integration tokens, credential IDs beyond configuration metadata, provider payloads, provider error bodies, search results, pages, databases, blocks, comments, request counters, or error counters outside process memory.
- Notion payloads can contain private workspace documents, page properties, databases, comments, user metadata, and email addresses. Treat live output as work-zone sensitive data unless the host supplies a stricter zone policy.
- Runtime search redacts person emails in `people` properties and user objects under `created_by` and `last_edited_by`.

## Network And Runtime Invariants

- Default runtime API URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1`.
- Direct token mode production host policy accepts `https://api.notion.com`.
- Loopback URLs are accepted for deterministic tests in direct token mode.
- `credential_id` mode allows custom absolute URLs after basic URL shape validation.
- Manifest operation network policy allows `api.notion.com` on port `443`, requires TLS/SNI, denies localhost, private ranges, tailnet ranges, and IP literals, caps redirects at zero, and caps response sizes by operation.
- Sandbox profile is `strict`, with `256 MB` memory, `50%` CPU, `120000 ms` wall-clock timeout, no exec, no ptrace, read-only `/usr` and `/lib`, and writable `$CONNECTOR_STATE`.
- The connector does not open inbound sockets.
- Provider 401 and 403 map to unauthorized.
- Provider 404 maps to resource not found.
- Provider 429 is retryable and honors `Retry-After` seconds, defaulting to 60 seconds when absent.
- Provider 5xx responses are retryable external errors.
- Other provider errors are terminal external API errors with truncated response bodies.

## Capability Families

| Capability | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `notion.read` | Read pages, databases, blocks, block children, comments, and database query results. |
| `notion.write` | Create or update pages, databases, blocks, block children, and comments. |
| `notion.delete` | Archive pages and blocks. |
| `notion.search` | Search across Notion objects shared with the integration. |

## Operation Inventory

## Resource URIs

Runtime capability-token verification currently checks capability and operation ID, but passes an empty resource binding list to the verifier. The effective authorization binding is capability plus operation, not a provider resource URI.

Follow-up work should add resource URI shapes such as:

| Operation family | Candidate resource URI shape |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Pages | `notion://page/{page_id}` |
| Databases or data sources | `notion://database/{database_id}` or `notion://data-source/{data_source_id}` |
| Blocks | `notion://block/{block_id}` |
| Comments | `notion://block/{block_id}/comments` |
| Workspace search | `notion://workspace/{workspace_id}/search` |

## Explicit Non-Goals

The current implementation does not include:

- Notion OAuth setup, token refresh, connection creation, capability provisioning, or workspace installation flows
- webhooks, subscription delivery, durable replay, event acknowledgement, or changed-object sync
- file uploads, file downloads, user directory enumeration, custom emoji management, views, templates, public-page publishing, workspace administration, or database/data-source migration tooling
- recursive block tree traversal, rich pagination helpers for block children or comments, or provider-side page-size controls outside current query/search paths
- data-source endpoint parity, `filter_properties`, view query APIs, or Notion SDK compatibility behavior
- durable storage of Notion pages, databases, comments, blocks, credentials, provider responses, or provider error bodies

These are excluded on purpose:

- Notion workspaces frequently contain private docs and comments. Reads and writes need explicit zone and capability boundaries before expanding the surface.
- Notion's database/data-source API model is moving. Endpoint parity should be deliberate rather than hidden behind broad compatibility shims.
- Write and delete operations mutate human-authored workspace content and need stronger approval/simulation parity before production promotion.

## Readiness And Verification Surface

`doctor()`, `health()`, `self_check()`, `simulate()`, `introspect()`, `invoke()`, and `shutdown()` are part of the public closeout contract. They surface:

- local configuration, client, request, and error counter state
- auth mode, API URL, and effective Notion version
- local network-constraint target checks
- credential-injection requirement for credential-id mode
- direct-token self-check through a live `POST /search` probe
- operation metadata generated by runtime code
- permissive simulation behavior
- typed provider/FCP error mapping
- search redaction behavior for email-bearing person and user fields

The deterministic integration evidence is anchored on connector-local tests covering:

- error taxonomy for 401, 403, 404, 429, and 5xx responses
- token redaction and Bearer auth headers
- page, database, block, search, and comment request paths
- connector invoke dispatch for every declared operation
- capability-token verification and wrong-capability rejection
- missing required fields and unknown operation rejection
- search sensitivity metadata and person/user email redaction
- custom API URLs, credential-id mode, Notion version override, doctor, self-check, and manifest hash stability
