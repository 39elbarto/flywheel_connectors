## Purpose

This document fixes the operator-facing contract for `fcp.openai`. The connector exposes OpenAI chat, embeddings, image generation, video generation, audio transcription, realtime transcription, realtime voice, browser realtime client-secret minting, text-to-speech, fine-tuning jobs, Assistants, Threads, messages, and runs.

The connector is broad, but it is not a credential store. OpenAI Codex OAuth/device-code transport is explicitly host-mediated and rejected inside connector-local configuration.

## Current Runtime Snapshot

The current runtime invoke IDs are:

- `openai.chat`
- `openai.simple_chat`
- `openai.get_usage`
- `openai.embeddings`
- `openai.images.generate`
- `openai.videos.generate`
- `openai.audio.transcribe`
- `openai.realtime.transcribe`
- `openai.realtime.voice`
- `openai.realtime.browser_session`
- `openai.audio.tts`
- `openai.finetune.create`
- `openai.finetune.list`
- `openai.finetune.get`
- `openai.finetune.cancel`
- `openai.finetune.events`
- `openai.assistants.create`
- `openai.assistants.list`
- `openai.assistants.get`
- `openai.assistants.delete`
- `openai.threads.create`
- `openai.threads.get`
- `openai.threads.messages.create`
- `openai.threads.messages.list`
- `openai.threads.runs.create`
- `openai.threads.runs.get`
- `openai.threads.runs.cancel`

Important runtime truths the contract preserves:

- Configuration accepts exactly one of `api_key` or `credential_id`.
- Credential IDs must parse as UUIDs and require host-side egress credential injection for live traffic.
- API-key mode sends `Authorization: Bearer ...`.
- Credential-id mode sends `X-FCP-Credential-ID`.
- Optional `organization` adds `OpenAI-Organization`.
- Optional `deployment_profile` can provide profile name, base URL, organization, and default model.
- Default base URL is `https://api.openai.com`.
- `https://api.openai.com`, `https://api.openai.com/v1`, `https://api.deepseek.com`, and `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` are allowed API origins, plus loopback HTTP/HTTPS for tests.
- Connector-local Codex OAuth/device-code fields are rejected, including access tokens, refresh tokens, device codes, authorization codes, and verifier material.
- Codex base URLs are canonicalized only to explain that connector-local Codex transport is deferred to host credential flows.
- Default chat model is `gpt-4o`.
- FCP subscribe is not implemented; streaming and realtime operations are bounded invoke paths.

## First-Slice Scope

The first OpenAI README slice documents the existing runtime surface:

- chat and simple chat through Chat Completions
- SSE chat streaming at the client layer
- embeddings with `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`
- image generation with DALL-E models
- video generation through asynchronous submit, polling, and video-byte download
- audio transcription through Whisper-compatible upload
- realtime transcription and realtime voice WebSocket sessions
- browser realtime client-secret creation for WebRTC SDP offer flows
- TTS audio generation
- fine-tune create/list/get/cancel/events operations
- Assistants create/list/get/delete operations
- Threads create/get, message create/list, and run create/get/cancel operations
- local token and cost accounting
- bound capability-token verification before dispatch

## Auth And Scope Boundary

- Authentication mechanisms: OpenAI API key or host-injected credential ID.
- Home zone: `z:work`.
- Allowed source zones: `z:owner`, `z:private`, and `z:work`.
- Allowed target zone: `z:work`.
- Forbidden source zone: `z:public`.
- Capability surface:
  - `openai.chat` gates chat, simple chat, and local usage accounting.
  - `openai.embeddings` gates embedding creation.
  - `openai.images` gates image generation.
  - `openai.videos` gates video generation.
  - `openai.audio.transcribe` gates file transcription.
  - `openai.realtime.transcribe` gates realtime transcription WebSocket sessions.
  - `openai.realtime.voice` gates realtime voice WebSocket sessions.
  - `openai.realtime.browser_session` gates browser client-secret minting.
  - `openai.audio.tts` gates text-to-speech.
  - Fine-tune, Assistants, Threads, messages, and runs each have operation-specific capabilities.
- The connector does not persist prompts, completions, streamed deltas, generated media, audio input, transcripts, realtime client secrets, fine-tune payloads, assistant instructions, thread messages, provider payloads, or provider responses.
- Credential-id mode is a host-egress contract, not direct proof that live OpenAI will accept the request without an injection layer.

## Network And Runtime Invariants

- Production hosts for most REST operations: `api.openai.com`, with `api.deepseek.com` also allowed by this connector's OpenAI-compatible base URL policy.
- Production host for OpenAI video, realtime, and browser client-secret flows: `api.openai.com`.
- Production port: `443`.
- TLS and SNI are required for live traffic.
- Manifest network policy denies localhost, private ranges, tailnet ranges, IP literals, and unsafe host forms for live operations.
- Localhost HTTP overrides are test-only.
- Standard REST connect timeout: `10_000 ms`.
- Standard REST total timeout: `120_000 ms`.
- Realtime total timeout defaults to `30_000 ms` and is bounded to `300_000 ms`.
- Realtime transcription processes at most `1024` server events; realtime voice processes at most `2048` events.
- Realtime audio chunks must be non-empty base64 and each decoded chunk must be at most `15 MiB`.
- Browser realtime client secrets default to `60 s` TTL and are capped at `600 s`.
- Maximum response bytes are `10_485_760` for standard responses, `52_428_800` for image/TTS audio, and `104_857_600` for downloaded video bytes.
- Sandbox profile is `strict`, with `256 MB` memory, `50%` CPU, `120_000 ms` wall-clock timeout, read-only `/usr` and `/lib`, no exec, and no ptrace.
- Event capability metadata declares streaming support, no replay, and a minimum buffer of 10 events.

## Capability Families

| Capability | Purpose |

| `openai.images` | Image generation. |
| `openai.videos` | Video job submission, polling, and download. |
| `openai.audio.transcribe` | File-based audio transcription. |
| `openai.realtime.transcribe` | Realtime transcription WebSocket sessions. |
| `openai.realtime.voice` | Realtime voice WebSocket sessions. |
| `openai.realtime.browser_session` | Ephemeral browser client-secret minting. |

## Operation Inventory

| Operation family | Invoke IDs | Safety and risk | Notes |
|------------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Chat | `openai.chat`, `openai.simple_chat`, `openai.get_usage` | Chat is `Safe`/`Medium`; usage is `Safe`/`Low` and `Strict` | Chat output is model-dependent. Usage reads local counters. |
| Embeddings | `openai.embeddings` | `Safe`/`Low` | Embedding generation is read-like but still provider-dispatched and input-sensitive. |
| Images and video | `openai.images.generate`, `openai.videos.generate` | `Safe`/`Medium` | Media generation returns base64 artifacts; video generation polls an async job and downloads final bytes. |
| Audio | `openai.audio.transcribe`, `openai.audio.tts` | `Safe`/`Medium` | Audio input/output is sensitive and must not be persisted by verification. |
| Realtime | `openai.realtime.transcribe`, `openai.realtime.voice`, `openai.realtime.browser_session` | `Safe`/`Medium` | WebSocket/WebRTC-oriented paths are bounded by event, timeout, audio-size, and TTL limits. |
| Fine-tuning | `openai.finetune.create`, `openai.finetune.cancel` | `Risky`/`High`, interactive approval | Create and cancel are mutating, cost-bearing operations. |
| Fine-tune reads | `openai.finetune.list`, `openai.finetune.get`, `openai.finetune.events` | `Safe`/`Low`, `Strict` | Read-only job status and event discovery. |
| Assistants | `openai.assistants.create`, `openai.assistants.delete` | Create is `Safe`/`Medium`; delete is mutating | Assistant writes require careful audit context. |
| Assistant reads | `openai.assistants.list`, `openai.assistants.get` | `Safe`/`Low`, `Strict` | Read-only assistant discovery. |
| Threads and runs | `openai.threads.create`, `openai.threads.messages.create`, `openai.threads.runs.create`, `openai.threads.runs.cancel` | Mixed medium risk, mutating where create/cancel | Thread and run operations affect provider-side state. |
| Thread reads | `openai.threads.get`, `openai.threads.messages.list`, `openai.threads.runs.get` | `Safe`/`Low`, `Strict` | Read-only state inspection. |

## Explicit Non-Goals

The current implementation does not include:

- connector-local Codex OAuth/device-code transport
- connector-local storage of OpenAI secrets
- Files API upload/download as a standalone operation surface
- persistent conversation, assistant, thread, run, media, or realtime state storage
- FCP subscription-based streaming
- public-zone invocation
- automatic use of unapproved public or private-network base URLs

These are excluded on purpose:

- Host credential flows own Codex OAuth/device-code credentials.
- Provider-side state creation and cancellation must remain capability-gated and auditable.
- Realtime client secrets and generated media are sensitive artifacts and should be returned only to authorized invoke callers.

## Readiness And Verification Surface

`doctor()`, `health()`, `self_check()`, `simulate()`, and `introspect()` are part of the public closeout contract. They surface:

- configuration, auth mode, base URL, organization, deployment profile, default model, request counters, error counters, token counters, and cost totals
- redacted auth labels rather than raw API keys or credential values
- base URL host policy, Codex transport rejection, and loopback test handling
- operation schemas, safety, risk, idempotency, and AI hints
- simulate-time capability-token checks against bound resources

The deterministic integration evidence is anchored on WireMock and connector-local tests covering:

- simple chat and multi-turn chat invokes
- system prompts
- SSE chunk parsing, tool-call deltas, and `[DONE]` termination
- tool/function-calling shapes
- 401, 429, 503, context-length, and content-filter error mapping
- usage and cost accounting
- default-deny capability-token behavior
- lifecycle behavior for configure, handshake, health, doctor, self-check, introspection, simulate, and shutdown
- base URL rejection for untrusted hosts
- realtime transcription and realtime voice WebSocket fixtures
- live verification skip/pass behavior gated by `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Source Notes

- `connectors/openai/src/client.rs` defines auth headers, organization headers, retry behavior, usage counters, health checks, REST calls, SSE parsing, embeddings, media, fine-tune, Assistants, Threads, and video polling behavior.
- `connectors/openai/src/connector.rs` defines configuration validation, Codex transport rejection, base URL normalization, deployment profile parsing, capability verification, operation dispatch, realtime WebSocket/WebRTC orchestration, introspection, simulation, and lifecycle behavior.
- `connectors/openai/src/types.rs` defines model IDs, pricing, message and tool shapes, embeddings, images, video, audio, TTS, fine-tune, Assistants, Threads, runs, and response types.
- `connectors/openai/manifest.toml` defines the broad operation catalog, network constraints, sandbox boundary, event capability metadata, and no-listener/no-storage/no-exec posture.
- `connectors/openai/tests/integration.rs` covers deterministic loopback, error behavior, capability boundaries, lifecycle, realtime WebSocket fixtures, and validation.
- `connectors/openai/tests/live_verification.rs` emits live skip/pass results when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent or present.

## Verification Bundle

There is no dedicated tracked `scripts/e2e/openai_connector_verification.sh` bundle in this checkout. The closeout surface is the crate-local test suite plus direct `rch` proof commands.

The verification surface captures:

- deterministic WireMock integration coverage
- live provider smoke tests gated by `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- realtime WebSocket fixture coverage
- formatting, check, and clippy proof through `rch`
- UBS on changed files before commit

## Operator Guidance

**Prerequisites**:

- Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` only for live provider verification.
- Use WireMock and local WebSocket fixtures for deterministic proof.
- Use `credential_id` for host-injected secretless deployments.

**Dedicated environment**:

- Prefer deterministic loopback evidence for routine verification.
- Use a test OpenAI account for live runs and keep live prompts intentionally small.
- Keep media, realtime, fine-tune, Assistants, Threads, and run operations out of live smoke unless the operator explicitly scopes and budgets them.

**Redaction rules**:

- Redact API keys, credential IDs where needed, prompts, completions, streamed deltas, tool-call arguments, embedding input and vectors, generated media bytes, audio input, transcripts, realtime client secrets, assistant instructions, thread messages, provider payloads, and provider error bodies.
- Verification output should use counts, byte lengths, operation IDs, status values, error classes, model IDs when non-sensitive, and cleanup state.

**Common remediation**:

- If `health` reports `not_configured`, configure with exactly one of `api_key` or `credential_id`, then run handshake.
- If `self_check` reports credential injection is required, run behind the host egress injection layer or switch to direct API-key mode for live probes.
- If base URL validation fails, use an allowed OpenAI-compatible origin or localhost for tests.
- If a Codex OAuth/device-code field is rejected, move that credential into host credential flows and reference it by `credential_id`.
- If realtime transcription fails before completion, check audio format, decoded chunk size, event cap, and timeout bounds.
- If browser realtime session creation fails, confirm the base URL is `api.openai.com` or a localhost test origin.
- If video generation times out, increase polling only within the documented bounds and check provider job status separately.
- If fine-tune create or cancel is requested, require explicit operator intent and record the provider job ID.

**Rerun commands**:
