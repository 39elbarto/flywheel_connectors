//! `CancellationController` track/cancel/complete + br-jdaro
//! principal-mismatch defense conformance.
//!
//! `fcp_host::CancellationController` is the per-operation
//! cancellation tracker that the host gateway exposes to the admin
//! API and to in-process callers. Two NORMATIVE properties drive
//! its design:
//!
//! 1. **State machine (br-2653).** `track` registers an operation,
//!    `complete` marks it finished, `cancel` requests cancellation.
//!    The outcome MUST be:
//!    - `Cancelled` on first cancel of a tracked, not-yet-completed,
//!       not-yet-cancelled operation,
//!    - `Pending` on a second cancel of an already-cancel-requested
//!       operation (idempotent),
//!    - `TooLate` when called after `complete`.
//! 2. **Principal-mismatch defense (br-jdaro).** When `track` was
//!    called with `Some(owner)`, `cancel` MUST reject any caller
//!    whose `asserted_principal` does not match the recorded owner —
//!    BEFORE any state mutation. Without this, a caller who guesses a
//!    client-chosen `operation_id` could cancel anyone's operations.
//!
//! Plus: cancel of an unknown operation returns
//! `HostError::ConnectorNotFound`; an audit event is recorded for
//! every cancel attempt; `track` with `None` owner is the legacy
//! permissive path that does NOT enforce principal matching.
