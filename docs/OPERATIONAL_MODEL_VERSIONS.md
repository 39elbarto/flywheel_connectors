## V1: Host-First (Legacy Rollback / Evaluation Boundary)

V1 is the legacy host-first provisioning boundary. It remains available for
explicit rollback and compatibility testing through
`FCP_TRUTH_PRECEDENCE_DEFAULT=v1`, but it is no longer the default
truth-precedence policy.

### What V1 Provides

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| `fwc -> fcp-host -> connector subprocesses` | Proven | CLI integration tests, host admin API, stdio/JSON-RPC supervision |
| Host-backed runtime answers | Proven | `crates/fwc/src/truth.rs` KnowledgeState taxonomy |
| Node-local truth resolution | Proven | `crates/fwc/src/catalog.rs` runtime mode dispatch |
| Offline artifact mode (explicit) | Proven | `--offline` flag, artifact-backed discovery |
| Single-active-host deployment | Proven | One `fcp-host` instance per node |
| Zone isolation (cryptographic) | Proven | Zone encryption keys, Tailscale ACL enforcement |
| Capability tokens (CWT/COSE) | Proven | CBOR-encoded, COSE-signed, revocation-checked |
| Tamper-evident audit chain | Proven | Hash-linked events, monotonic seq, quorum checkpoints |
| Revocation enforcement | Implemented | First-class revocation objects, O(1) freshness checks |
| Egress proxy with CIDR deny | Implemented | Manifest-aware network guardrails |
| Secretless connector flows | Implemented | `credential_id` host-side injection |
| Supply chain attestations | Implemented | Registry attestation schemas, verification policy |

### What V1 Does NOT Provide

- Automatic multi-node placement or failover
- Mesh-backed answers (answers backed by distributed mesh state)
- Cross-device symbol reconstruction
- Automatic computation migration between devices
- Mesh-native gossip-based state sync as the primary truth source

### V1 Operator Contract

Treat this as the minimum honest contract for the boundary that still exists
today, not as the architecture contributors should optimize around long term.

1. Start `fcp-host` on the node where connectors will run.
2. Use `fwc --host http://<host>:<port>` for all live operations.
3. Trust host-backed answers as authoritative for current runtime state.
4. Use `--offline` explicitly when you want artifact-backed data.
5. Do not assume mesh-native features are available.

## V2: Mesh-Native Truth Precedence (Operational Default, Hybrid Execution)

V2 is operational for truth precedence and answer classification. In
`crates/fwc/src/truth.rs`, `TruthPrecedencePolicy::default()` returns
`TruthPrecedencePolicy::v2_default()` unless the explicit
`FCP_TRUTH_PRECEDENCE_DEFAULT=v1` rollback override is set. The V2 source
ordering is `MeshBacked > HostBacked > NodeLocal > Offline`, with fallback
allowed by policy.

This does not mean every command is already mesh-routed. Execution remains
hybrid: commands classify answers under the V2 policy today, but many live
operations still materialize through the host-backed provisioning path until
the scorecard cutover gates are satisfied.

### What V2 Provides Today

| Capability | Current Status | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| V2 truth precedence default | Operational | `TruthPrecedencePolicy::default()` resolves to `V2MeshNative` unless `FCP_TRUTH_PRECEDENCE_DEFAULT=v1` is set |
| Mesh-backed answers (highest confidence) | Operational when mesh evidence exists | `LiveTruthResolver` classifies mesh-backed answers highest and falls back under policy |
| Host-backed fallback under V2 | Operational | V2 keeps `HostBacked` below `MeshBacked` and above `NodeLocal` / `Offline` |
| Multi-node device mesh (Tailscale peers) | Implemented, cutover-gated | MeshNode, gossip, IBLT, XOR filters exist; production default routing still depends on scorecard gates |
| Symbol-first object distribution | Implemented | RaptorQ codec, object-symbol framing, repair machinery in-tree |
| Automatic computation migration | Designed | Migration state machines exist, not operational default |
| Cross-device secret reconstruction | Implemented | Shamir sharing + FROST threshold signing exist |
| Mesh-native gossip sync | Implemented, cutover-gated | Gossip protocol with consistency checks exists; not yet the only production state source |
| Automatic failover / placement | Designed | ObjectPlacementPolicy and RepairController exist |
| Offline resilience via symbol locality | Designed | Probabilistic availability model, not yet E2E proven |

### V2 Cutover Gates

The transition from V2 truth-precedence default to fully mesh-routed execution
requires completing these gates:

1. Production evidence that mesh-backed answers are correct and consistent.
2. Zone-wide TruthPrecedencePolicy enforcement beyond the current `fwc` policy surface (all operators in a zone see the same answer).
3. Proven multi-node placement and failover for at least one real workload.
4. Mesh-native gossip as the default state sync mechanism (not just available, but default).
5. Operator documentation that teaches V2 as the primary path (this document is part of that rewrite).

The FCP3 Transition Scorecard (`docs/FCP3_Transition_Scorecard.md`) tracks
progress toward these gates. Gate 5 is addressed by the current teaching-surface
rewrite (bead z1nkz.1).

## FWC Command Truth-Source Matrix

Every `fwc` command is classified under the V2 truth hierarchy by default
(mesh-backed > host-backed > node-local > offline). The table below is a
cutover map: it shows which commands still depend on host-backed execution,
which ones are already honest offline artifact workflows, and where mesh-backed
execution is expected to replace the transitional path.

## How to Check Your Current Version

```bash
# The answer classification tells you what version you're operating under.
# V2 truth precedence is the default. If an answer reports "host-backed" or
# "node-local", that answer fell back under V2 policy. If it reports
# "mesh-backed", that answer has the highest-confidence V2 evidence.
fwc --host http://127.0.0.1:8787 mesh explain-availability <connector>
```
